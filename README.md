# Core Computer Science Concepts:
This repository is my revision work from experience all over the years, practiced in a week for technical tests at various.
- If the files don't render, could be because of the images clicked to consolidate concepts from all over the place.
- Trust me this work can help anyone stuck in the journey of DSA revision.
- Better idea is to clone in the above case and check on Desktop client, than on web-version of GitHub.

All the best! Wish me luck too .. ðŸ˜Š
